# Utilizing Dixon - Coles paper for football match predictions in R

Modelling Association Football Scores and Inefficiencies in the Football Betting Market (Mark J. Dixon and Stuart G. Coles, 1997), is a wide-known paper that proposes
two main changes to the basic Poisson model for predicting football matches' outcomes. These changes (a) try to ontroduce an interaction term to correct underestimated frequency of 
low scoring matches and (b) apply time decay component so that recent matches are weighted more strongly

In this project, I used R to get predictions for the games that take place in the English Premier League
